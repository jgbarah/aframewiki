# Component Directory

## Origin
This is the modern, community-maintained alternative to the out-of-date A-Frame Registry.

The historical standard has been to publish and search for component on A-Frame. This adds some overhead, though, and only searching on NPM can mean missing a lot of possible projects. A-Frame doesn't require a complex build process, either, so installing with NPM may not always be the best fit--the community can get a speed boost to our pages by all using the same cached CDNs, actually.

The focus here is not on the original author's repo, but on the most up-to-date fork available of a repo. If two forks are both viable with unique features, they can both be listed separately.

## Notes for editors

- Listings should be alphabetized. Where the name begins with "A-" or "a-" or "aframe-", it should be ignore for alphabetizing purposes, and removed from the listing title. "-component" should also be removed from the listing title.

- You may find it easier to edit the table in an external markdown editor such as Typora. Just copy/paste the whole article across, make your edits, and copy/paste back.

- Please avoid pasting raw links into the table as they mess with formatting (the markdown renderer refuses to split them, so everything gets pushed off to the right). To be clear: share links using this markdown code: `[link text](https://link.com)`, which will look like this: [link text](https://link.com).


## Notable collections of components

[A-Frame's built-in components](https://aframe.io/docs/1.3.0/components/animation.html) 

[A-Frame Extras set of additional components](https://github.com/c-frame/aframe-extras)

[Superframe components]( https://supermedium.com/superframe/)

Other community components mentioned in the [A-Frame docs](https://aframe.io/docs/1.3.0/introduction/#off-you-go) include:

> [environment](https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-environment-component), [state](https://npmjs.com/package/aframe-state-component), [particle systems](https://github.com/c-frame/aframe-particle-system-component), [physics](https://github.com/c-frame/aframe-physics-system), [multiuser](https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe), [oceans](https://github.com/c-frame/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/primitives), [teleportation](https://github.com/fernandojsg/aframe-teleport-controls), [super hands](https://github.com/c-frame/aframe-super-hands-component), and [augmented reality](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js#augmented-reality-for-the-web-in-less-than-10-lines-of-html).

## Directory of individual components

Note, this directory does not include A-Frame built-in components - for which you can refer to the [A-Frame documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/1.3.0/components/animation.html).

This table is always a work in progress. Currently all of the following collections have been folded in:

- Original A-Frame registry
- A-Frame extras
- Superframe

If you find something that isn't here add it! If you build something, add it! Old components can also be added, just list the version number; someone could find a valuable starting point and fork and revive it.
