# Multi-user experiences over the network

A-Frame, like the rest of WebXR, has no built-in synchronization between clients.
So, when two users attempt to grab an object at the same time, in general it's possible for one client to calculate that one user has grabbed the object first, while another client calculates a different user.

Different technologies have different tradeoffs, so begin with the end in mind.

## Technologies

### [Networked A-Frame (NAF)](https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe)

Straightforward synchronization of the attributes of A-Frame entities, over WebRTC and/or WebSockets.
Requires [running your own synchronization server](https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe/blob/master/docs/getting-started-local.md#setup-the-server).

Can do anything, but has a reputation for being tricky to get working the way you want it.

### [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/)

A complete shared virtual world implementation, with good support for personal computer and mobile users.
Content management tools allow building worlds without code, and without running your own synchronization server.

However, adding A-Frame components requires running your own synchronization server or using Hubs Cloud, to serve a custom client.
Uses forked versions of A-Frame and NAF, so compatibility with 3rd-party components is far from guaranteed.


### [A-Frame Croquet Component](https://github.com/NikolaySuslov/aframe-croquet-component)

[Croquet OS](https://croquet.studio/docs/) is real-time synchronization-as-a-service (and not restricted to WebXR).
You don't run your own synchronization server; large traffic volumes would require payment.
It's designed around keeping state in its own Model objects, which have a number of restrictions so each client maintains a bit-identical simulation.
Web apps which keep all state and modeling in Croquet Models avoid the who-grabbed-it-first problem.
It keeps snapshots, so the state of a session is maintained, even after all users have gone off-line.
It has its own *Worldcore* library to handle the scene graph and rendering.
It also has a Unity interface in beta.

However, you don't have to use Worldcore, and can use the [A-Frame Croquet Component](https://github.com/NikolaySuslov/aframe-croquet-component) to synchronize the attributes of A-Frame entities.
Off-the-shelf A-Frame components maintain state internally, so don't gain the full advantage of Croquet OS.
(And if you're re-writing a component, you should consider using Worldcore.)

It's super-easy to [throw together a multi-user experience](https://github.com/NikolaySuslov/aframe-croquet-component#how-to-share-an-entity-in-an-a-frame-scene-with-other-users) (without voice chat), but as an immature library, you might have to code and submit a PR to get advanced capabilities.

* state snapshots: world state preserved even with no users online
* synced random seeds: these are commonly used to procedurally generate the same world on each client.
