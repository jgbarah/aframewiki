# Postprocessing

As of version 1.4.1 (January 2023), A-Frame doesn't natively support three.js postprocessing, but there are ways to make it work.
Here's an [example](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/anaglyph-postprocessing?path=index.html) showing the anaglyph postprocessing effect that Diarmid did a little while ago.
Similar techniques will probably work for other postprocessing effects.

Really old [aframe-effects](https://github.com/wizgrav/aframe-effects) is also available (and seeking a maintainer);

Newer with a custom build of aframe 1.4.2 that has a threejs patch for postprocessing in VR: [Akbartus's A-Frame-Component-Postprocessing](https://github.com/akbartus/A-Frame-Component-Postprocessing)

See also [this discussion started in June 2018](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/3645) about introducing a postprocessing API in A-Frame.

Hubs integrated (October 2022) in their [scene renderer](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs/pull/5742) the [postprocessing library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postprocessing)
but they don't use the A-Frame renderer anymore, so finding a good API for A-Frame from the discussion above is still needed.
